The wall and ceiling paintings date from different time periods.</p>
<p>Some of the paintings on the vault may be dated indirectly by observing features derived from a specific model. The urban structures (houses) of cylindrical shape with low domes, accompanied by narrow peaked towers (probably minarets), appear to be patterned on images included in maps of the Holy Land published no earlier than 1882 (according to the study of Rehav Rubin; see below). These vault murals should consequently be dated to the approximate period 1883-1890. For Rubin's study, see:</p>
<p dir=\"RTL\">ריכב (בוני) רובין, <em>צורת הארץ: ארץ ישראל במפה העברית מרש\"י ועד ראשית המאה העשרים</em>&nbsp;(ירושלים: יד יצחק בן צבי,&nbsp;2014)&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, one may presume that the date of the painted canvas on the ceiling must correspond to the date of the Torah ark with which it blends artistically. According to an accompanying inscription, the Torah ark was created in 1861.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wall paintings in the main prayer hall appear to have been created ca. 1920.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The condition of the vault paintings is poor. The canvas fabric is torn in many places, and large fragments of the paintings have been damaged by humidity and mold. By contrast, the Torah ark and wall paintings already underwent restoration in 2010.</p>

<p>The paintings on the ceiling canvas comprise the central section of the vault plafond. This central space is surrounded by two lower tiers of wide decorative borders containing various additional paintings. A double-headed heraldic eagle bearing the triple Habsburg crown appears at the very center of the vault against a background of blue sky and gold stars. A wreath of red and white roses encircles the eagle. A large garland of roses also separates the central space (with eagle and sky) from a broad border ground with rocaille cartouches, medallions, and stylized monkeys.</p>
