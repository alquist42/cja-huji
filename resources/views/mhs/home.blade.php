                The Jewish presence in Europe goes back over 2,500 years and this is reflected in a rich and remarkable
                cultural legacy stretching right across the continent -
                north to south, east to west.<br><br>

                The most emblematic feature of the Jewish communities in the cities, towns and villages of Europe has
                been the synagogues they built,
                many of them displaying real artistic and architectural accomplishment. These buildings are portals into
                the Jewish life that they
                nurtured and sustained, and it is to these sites - and their communities - that this website is
                dedicated.<br><br>

                The <b>Foundation for Jewish Heritage</b> has as its mission the preservation of Jewish Heritage and its
                approach has been to consider the issue from
                a comprehensive and strategic perspective. Hence one of its first acts was to commission the <b>Center
                    for Jewish Art</b> at the Hebrew University of
                Jerusalem to use its extensive knowledge and expertise to provide an inventory of all the historic
                synagogues of Europe.
                <i>Never before has such a listing been brought together in one location and made publicly
                    available.</i><br><br>

                In addition, and crucial for the Foundation's own purposes, the Center was asked to rate the historic
                synagogues according to two categories:
                (i) <b>significance</b> and (ii) <b>condition of building fabric</b>. This will enable the Foundation to
                focus its efforts on the most important sites most at risk.<br><br>


                However, as well as guiding the Foundation's future work, this research also serves a broader purpose;
                bringing to a wide audience the current situation of the historic synagogues of Europe - both
                achievements in terms of
                preservation, and challenges that remain. In so doing, the website aims to promote a debate - and
                activity - to ensure that all the
                synagogues in danger are acknowledged, assessed and ultimately preserved.<p>

                    So this site is a call to action. Yet it is also a celebration, recognising a remarkable
                    millennia-old Jewish presence,
                    and a unique contribution to European cultural heritage.</p>
