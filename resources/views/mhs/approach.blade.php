                        The purpose of the research being presented through this website is to provide a comprehensive
                        and up-to-date inventory of the historic synagogues of Europe.
                        In so doing, we have used the following definitions to guide our approach.

                        <h5>Historic Synagogues</h5>

                        'Historic synagogues' are defined as all pre-World War Two structures and important post-War
                        synagogues.

                        <h5>Europe</h5>

                        The countries of Europe covered by the research are in accordance with the 47 Member States of
                        the Council of Europe with the addition of Belarus.

                        The Community category describes the particular 'denominational' strands of Judaism that have
                        been linked to the synagogue.

                    <h5>Historic Synagogues - Significance</h5>
                    There are three criteria that have been applied in order to evaluate the importance of an historic
                    synagogue:<br><br>
                    a. architectural and artistic significance
                    <ul>
                        <lu>
                            <li> belonging to a particular historical period or artistic trend - for example Gothic,
                                Baroque, Art Deco.
                                We deploy the terminology commonly used in the country concerned, as well as
                                corresponding style names used across Europe. This may be reflected throughout the
                                building or in particular architectural elements.
                            </li>
                        </lu>
                        <lu>
                            <li> possessing artistic decoration - for example sculpture, stucco decoration, stained
                                glass windows, and wall paintings. Works of artistic craftship are important in their
                                own right and impact on the significance of the entire building.
                            </li>
                        </lu>
                    </ul>

                    b. urban significance
                    <ul>
                        <lu>
                            <li> belonging to a larger historical compound - for example Jewish quarter, Jewish street,
                                or so-called <i>shulhoyf</i>
                                (a compound of several synagogues and Jewish communal buildings).
                            </li>
                        </lu>

                        <lu>
                            <li> belonging to a larger townscape - for example skyline, city square or street.</li>
                        </lu>
                    </ul>

                    c. historical significance
                    <ul>
                        <lu>
                            <li> witnessing a particular historical event or belonging to a particular historical
                                period.
                            </li>
                        </lu>

                        <lu>
                            <li> reflected in folk legends or other forms of collective memory.</li>
                        </lu>

                        <lu>
                            <li> related to a person of public interest.</li>
                        </lu>

                        <lu>
                            <li> being the only, or one of a few, examples of a notable building type.</li>
                        </lu>
                    </ul>
                    <div>Integral to applying these criteria to each synagogue is the dimension of public understanding

                    <div>The significance of a synagogue is put in jeopardy if it is not properly maintained.<br><br>
                        There are two aspects to assessing the condition of the building fabric of a synagogue:
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    a. building use
                    <ul style="line-height:20px">

                        Permanent use of a building supports its preservation and reduces the possibility of
                        deterioration. Conversely, abandoned buildings are automatically considered at risk.
                    </ul>

                    b. maintenance
                    <ul>
                        The technical condition of a building reflects the level of care and maintenance it receives.
                    </ul>


                    Risk assessments have been carried out by heritage experts and applied to each synagogue following
                    an A-E rating system explained below.
